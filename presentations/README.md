## Purpose

These presentations document the **evolution of the project** from proposal through final deployment and demonstrate:

- System-level design thinking
- Hardware–software co-design methodology
- Experimental results and performance evaluation
- Clear communication of technical concepts

All slides are aligned with the written report and the repository implementation.
