# Static Presentation Slides

This directory contains **non-recorded (static) presentation materials** for the AI Hardware project.

## Contents

- **Midterm Presentation**  
  Slides used for the midterm project checkpoint, covering early design decisions, model architecture, and planned hardware acceleration.

- **Project Proposal**  
  Initial proposal slides and supporting documents outlining the problem motivation, system architecture, and expected outcomes.

## Notes

- These files contain **static slides only** (no embedded video or audio).
- The **recorded final presentation** is stored separately as:

This separation ensures clarity between archived presentation materials and the final recorded submission.
